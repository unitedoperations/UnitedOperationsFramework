## Features

* Enable or disable prevention of negligent discharges of:
  1. Rifles
  2. Pistols 
  3. Launchers


While the player is:

* __*Within a specified radius from their spawn location*__

* __*And until a certain time limit has been reached*__

The module will prevent players from causing damage through negligent discharge (ND).

## Usage

### Enabling Anti-ND

* Open the UO Framework Menu and select Module Settings.
<!-- - ![Framework Tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/images/generic/generic_framework_tab.png){:class="img-responsive"} -->
<!-- TODO: Replace image above with one containing the UO Framework tab and the Module Settings sub-menu button. -->

* Open the Anti-ND Settings tab and change settings appropriately.
<!-- - ![image-title-here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/images/core/anti_nd_configuration.png){:class="img-responsive"}  -->
<!-- TODO: Add image of the module settings button and the anti-nd module settings dropdown.  -->

You can configure the timing after player spawn (or JiP) and distance from the spawn location here. \\
**These settings apply to all factions and all players.**
