## Features

The safe start module provides:
- Start Lowered
  - Start players with their weapons loaded.
- Start Unloaded
  - Start players without a magazine in their rifle.

Both of these features can be used to prevent negligent discharge etc.

## Usage

### Start Lowered and Start Unloaded

``Framework Settings -> Module Settings -> Safe Start Settings``

#### Start Lowered

By checking this box, all players will load into the mission with their guns lowered.

#### Start Unloaded

This will take any automatically added magazines out of the equipped weapon on a player. This could cause overflow so make sure to test!
