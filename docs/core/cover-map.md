## Features

Cover-Map module is provides these features:
- Per faction Cover-map sides.
- Multiple areas which swapped through ACE Self-Interactions.

## Usage

### Per faction "Maps"

Making per faction AOs with the cover-map module is quite easy.
1. Open module settings and enable the Cover-Map module.
2. Designate the names you want to use for your faction(s).
  - i.e. REDFOR AO is called ``redAO`` and BLUFOR AO is called ``blueAO``.
3. Add a cover-map object to your mission and match it's ``AO Name`` attribute to match the zone you designated for that faction.

This will add a basic per faction AO as designated by the zone.

Note, these differing versions of the map cannot be viewed by players on a different faction.
