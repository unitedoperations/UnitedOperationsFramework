## Features

- Adds placeable zones to restrict the movement of units at the start of a mission.

## Usage

### Using Setup Timer Zones

Navigate to UOF Place-able Zones and select your choice of Setup Timer Zone.
<!-- Re-phrase above ASAP! -->
Now place the zone down in the editor keeping the units you want to limit within the zone. Select the appropriate faction for the playable units.

<!-- ![~Example Zone~]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/images/setup-timer/example.png){:class="img-responsive"} -->

At the start of your mission units will now be limited to the specified zone and have a visible count-down displayed on their screen so long as they are on the appropriate faction.
